Hoiio SDK
============================================

This is an unofficial Python SDK to consume `Hoiio API telephony services <http://developer.hoiio.com>`_.

Using the SDK, developers can easily invoke any of `Hoiio RESTful APIs <http://developer.hoiio.com/docs>`_. Start with :doc:`quickstart`, and then proceed to :doc:`complete/index` that includes all the magic that you need to know!
